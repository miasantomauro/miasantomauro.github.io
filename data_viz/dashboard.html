		<h1>Written Questions</h1>
		<h3>Describe how your dashboard answers the questions presented.</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				My first visualization address the first question (top 10 games of
				all time or for a specific year).
				In order to view the top ten video games for a certain year,
				the user just has to select a year from the drop down. The values
				in the drop down represent the range of years the database accounts for.
				A user can also select the "All Time" option to view the top games,
				regardless of the year they were released.
				Please note that I interpreted the prompt as the top ten games
				<i>released</i> in a given year. I compared the overal sales rank of
				each game to get the top ten games.
			</li>
			<li>
				My second visualization addresses the second question,
				and represents the top genres, and their
				relative popularity in different regions (Japan, Europe, US, and Elsewhere).
				I chose to use total sales to represent popularity because it encapsulates
				information about number of titles sold, as well as number of copies of those titles sold.
			</li>
			<li>
				My third visualization addresses the third question.
				In order to determine the best publisher for a genre, one could
				select whichever genre they're interested in and the pie chart
				will display what percentage of global sales are accounted for by
				each of the top publishers in that genre. The user has the option
				to view the top 1, 2, 3, or 4 top publishers for each genre.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>List 3 reasons why D3 was helpful and improved your visualization.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				D3 provided useful functions for creating the scales.
				These functions allowed me to easily make x and y axes, as
				well as color and category mappings.
			</li>
			<li>
				D3's syntax allows for chaining multiple operations, which makes
				creating and appending elements easy.
			</li>
			<li>
				D3 provides a lot the same useful functions of jquery that I'm
				personally used to, so translating from one to the other was
				relatively simple.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>List 3 reasons why D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				One thing I found troubling was that most of the tutorials
				I found used trivial data sets. It was tough to figure out
				how to adapt the tutorials to the dataset I had to use.
			</li>
			<li>
				Another thing about d3 I found challenging was appending
				multiple "sibling" elements. As far as I can tell,
				there isn't a concise way to do this.
			</li>
			<li>
				I could be mistaken, but based on the information I found online,
				d3 does not lend itself well to responsive size units.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			Give two different ways in which graphs may confuse or mislead viewers.<br/>
			What are ways to avoid this or fix these issues?
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				One way graphs can mislead viewers is through improper scaling
				of the y axis. This can be fixed by using the data to
				generate the scale.
			</li>
			<li>
				Graphs can be misleading if they are simply the wrong type of graph
				to display their data. For example, you shouldn't use a histogram
				to represent categorical data. A bar graph would probably be
				more appropriate.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>
			Find a real world example of a strong data graphic and explain what it does well.<br/>
			Next, find a not-as-good data graphic and explain what it does poorly and how to improve it.
		</h3>

			<p>
				<a href="http://hereistoday.com/" target="_blank">Here</a>
				is a great data visualization.
			</p>

			<p>
				It uses color and proportions in a clear and intuitive way
				in order to illustrate the relative length of a day, week, month etc.
				It also uses the actual current date in order to make even more of an impact.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/other/what-your-brand-color-says-about-your-business" target="_blank">Here</a>
				is a pretty misleading data visualization.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the most confusing sections is the "Favorite Colors regardless of Age or Gender" section,
				which ironically uses gendered images to get their point across.
				Additionally, it makes a point about warm colors, then uses red, orange, and brown
				as the examples. I was expecting red, orange, and yellow to be the examples.
			</p>
