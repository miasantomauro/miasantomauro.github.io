Hi there!

I only know how to use ssh/scp... I never set up fastx so I can't
be sure that everything works on a dept machine. For your reference,
I am using a macbook.

Now I know that my first visualization isn't technically a graph...
But I do think an ordered list is the best way to display the top ten games
based on their ranks provided by Kaggle. The rank they provide
creates a logical linear order for the games.

If this doesn't count as one of my three graphs, I understand! :^)

I made additional filters and tooltips to hopefully offset this!

Thanks 4 grading! Stay safe + healthy :^) <3
