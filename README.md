## Project Descriptions

# CSCI 1951a: Data Science
This is a data visualization project I did for class, in which I had to answer questions about the Video Game Database on Kaggle using graphs. These graphs address which were the top ranking games for each year, which publishers make the most sales (and in which genres), and which genres are the most popular (based on sales).

# HIST 1210a: The Viking Age
This is my final project for The Viking Age, in which I analyzed Njal's Saga.
