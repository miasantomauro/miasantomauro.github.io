	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Aside from runic inscriptions, no written sources persist which are both
		from the Viking Age and from Scandinavians themselves.
		The primary sources that inform us about the Vikings during the
		Viking Age belong to two main categories:
		'contemporary external sources' and 'later internal sources'.
	</p>

	<p>
		This project explores one of the most important 'later internal source':
		<b>Njal's Saga</b>. Njal's Saga is believed to have been written in
		the late 12th Century, and recounts events around the year 1000.
		As a result of this separation by time, the text has a tendency to
		take on a nostalgic tone in its construction and maintenence of a
		collective memory. While it does reflect Icelandic values and customs,
		this collective memory is not always historically factual.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to drive my analysis of the text, I created a series
		of Magic: The Gathering inspired cards. Though my original intent
		was to create hard copies and produce historical simulations through play,
		I thought it best to 'digitize' my project given current global circumstances.
		(In other words, I am quarantined away from anyone who has interest in playing this game).
		I'd like to think I am somewhat like Gunnar at the end of chapter 56, who "remained honorably at home".

	<h3>Process</h3>
	<p>This project had three main development phases:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Research</li>
		<li>Analysis</li>
		<li>Site Construction</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b>Research</b></p>
	<p>
		I read and annotated Njal's saga. I tracked characters and themes on
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3dz_geGlzB5X0WOL4LX65U8PC8axMltsZIAgx3ODiU/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Document</a>.
		Note that you must be using a Brown University email to access this link.
	</p>

	<p><b>Analysis</b></p>
	<p>
		I determined which themes I would focus on, then used the quotations
		I compiled to summarize their significance in the text.
	</p>

	<p><b>Site Construction</b></p>
	<p>
		I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to construct this site!
